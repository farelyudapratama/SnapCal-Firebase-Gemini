# Additional Method Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines additional fixes made to the application to ensure proper functioning of image utilities and analysis features.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Added Missing `getBase64FromImagePath` Method
- Added the missing `getBase64FromImagePath` method to `ImageUtils` class
- This method is called from `FoodRepository.analyzeFoodByCustomModel` and is used to convert an image file to base64 format for API requests
- Implemented to use the existing `prepareImageForBase64` method with proper error handling

### 2. Added Missing TFLite Analysis Methods
- Added `analyzeWithTFLite` method to `FoodRepository` (placeholder implementation)
- Added `analyzeWithTFLite` method to `FoodViewModel` to connect UI calls with repository

### 3. Completed Method Chain
- Ensured proper method chain from View → ViewModel → Repository → Utils for all image analysis flows
- Fixed method signatures to use consistent parameter types

## Future Considerations
- Implement proper TFLite integration for local analysis
- Add comprehensive error handling for image processing
- Consider using a dedicated image processing library for more advanced features
- Add unit tests to verify correct image processing chain
