# Local Database Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to fix issues with the local Room database in the SnapCal-Firebase-Gemini application.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing DAO Method
- Added the missing `insertFood(food: FoodEntity)` method to `FoodDao` interface
- This method was referenced in `FoodRepository` but was not defined in the interface

### 2. Method Name Mismatch
- Fixed a method name mismatch where the repository was calling `deleteFood(id)` but the DAO implemented `deleteFoodById(id)`
- Updated the repository to use the correct method name

### 3. Added Type Converters
- Created a `Converters` class to handle type conversions for Room
- Added `@TypeConverters(Converters::class)` annotation to the `AppDatabase` class
- This ensures proper conversions between Java/Kotlin types and SQLite types

### 4. Improved Database Migration
- Enhanced the `MIGRATION_1_2` implementation with proper error handling
- Added code to create the required table structure if it doesn't exist
- This makes the migration more robust and prevents crashes when upgrading

### 5. Added Missing Query Method
- Added the `getAllFoods()` query method to `FoodDao` to support repository cache functions

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test the app with a clean installation to verify initial database creation
2. Test upgrading from a previous version (if available) to ensure migration works
3. Test all food-related functions (add, edit, delete, view) to ensure database operations work correctly
4. Verify that cached food items appear correctly when offline

## Future Considerations
- Consider using proper schema versioning with Room (enable `exportSchema = true`)
- Consider implementing more robust migration testing
- Consider adding automatic database backups before migrations
