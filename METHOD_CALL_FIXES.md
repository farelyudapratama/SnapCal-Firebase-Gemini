# Method Call Fixes in FoodViewModel

## Overview
This document outlines the changes made to fix incorrect method calls between view components, the FoodViewModel, and the FoodRepository.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Added Missing Repository Methods
- Added `analyzeImage(imageFile: File)` method to bridge between ViewModel and repository
- Added `analyzeWithCustomModel(imageFile: File)` method to bridge between ViewModel and repository
- Added `uploadFood(food: Food, imageFile: File?)` method to bridge between ViewModel and repository
- Added `updateFood(foodId: String, updateData: UpdateFoodData)` overload method

### 2. Fixed View Method Calls
- In `EditFoodScreen.kt`: Changed `deleteFoodImageById(foodId)` to `deleteFoodImage(foodId)`
- In `AnalyzeScreen.kt`: Updated `analyzeImage(imagePath, service)` to `analyzeImage(File(imagePath))`
- In `AnalyzeScreen.kt`: Updated `analyzeFoodByMyModel(imagePath)` to `analyzeWithCustomModel(File(imagePath))`
- In `AnalyzeScreen.kt`: Fixed `uploadFood(imagePath, foodData)` to use the new method signature
- In `ManualEntryScreen.kt`: Fixed both instances of `uploadFood` to use the new method signature

### 3. Method Parameter Transformations
- For `uploadFood`, we now convert the raw data into a `Food` object before passing to the repository
- For image analyses, we now use `File` objects instead of path strings

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test all food-related functions (add, analyze, edit, delete) to ensure proper functionality
2. Verify that image upload, deletion, and analysis work correctly
3. Check that all API calls and local database operations succeed

## Future Considerations
- Consider using consistent parameter types across the application
- Add validation to prevent issues with null or empty values
- Consider implementing better error handling for file operations
- Consider adding a dedicated mapper/converter layer to standardize transformations between model representations
