# UI Refresh Enhancements

This document outlines the changes made to improve automatic data refreshing across the application screens.

## MainScreen Improvements

1. **Auto-Refresh on Navigation**
   - Added LaunchedEffect to detect when returning to the MainScreen
   - Automatically refreshes data when navigation occurs to ensure most recent data

2. **Data Update Observation**
   - Added `dataUpdated` flag in FoodViewModel to track when data changes occur in other parts of the app
   - MainScreen observes this flag and automatically refreshes data when changes are detected

3. **Improved Pull-to-Refresh**
   - Fixed PullToRefreshBox to properly track loading state
   - Removed redundant isRefreshing state, using viewModel's isLoading instead
   - Ensures refresh indicators properly reflect the loading state

## DetailFoodScreen Improvements

   - Enhanced LaunchedEffect to always refresh data when navigating to DetailFoodScreen
   - Ensures that food details are always up-to-date, even after edits in other screens

## ManualEntryScreen Improvements

1. **Fixed Image Selection**
   - Removed premature upload when selecting an image
   - Now only stores the URI until the complete form is submitted
   - Prevents issues with partial uploads

## FoodViewModel Enhancements

1. **Data Update Signaling**
   - Added `_dataUpdated` flag to signal when data changes occur
   - Updated reset methods to properly manage all state flags
